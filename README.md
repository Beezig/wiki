# Welcome to the Beezig Wiki¶

Beezig is a huge Minecraft Plugin for [The Hive](https://hivemc.com/) \(Java\), created by RoccoDev and ItsNiklass. It is available for LabyMod and 5zig. Additionally, there is an expansion for Forge clients available - BeezigForge.

The [Beezig Team](https://github.com/Beezig/) has multiple plugins for different versions.

### Beezig for 5zig[¶]() <a id="beezig-for-5zig"></a>

The original plugin for the 5zig mod. This was the first project, started back in March 2017. It includes all base features. [Beezig/Beezig](https://github.com/Beezig/Beezig)

### BeezigLaby for LabyMod[¶]() <a id="beeziglaby-for-labymod"></a>

A recode of the original plugin for LabyMod 3 and is essentially the same code. This supports almost all base features and more. This project was started in January 2019. [Beezig/BeezigLaby](https://github.com/Beezig/BeezigLaby)

### BeezigForge Extension for Forge[¶]() <a id="beezigforge-extension-for-forge"></a>

Out of frustration by limited abilities, we created an 'Addon', which acts as an expansion for the normal Plugin with more features. This requires a Forge installation. For 5zig, there is an option in the [installer](https://beezig.eu/installation/) to additionally download BeezigForge. [Beezig/BeezigForge](https://github.com/Beezig/BeezigForge)

 If you are using the LabyMod version, this addon is already bundled in.

Just launch LabyMod in a Forge environment.
