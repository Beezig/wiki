# Invite your Discord friends to your party
!!! info
    This requires that you and all the friends you want to invite use Beezig **6.1.0**+.

After you've created a party, you can set it up to make your Discord friends join it.

!!! abstract "Requirements"
    * You need to be the **party leader** in order to set up the party for Discord integration.
    * Your Discord status can't be set to Offline/Invisible.
    * You need to have `Game Activity` turned on in your Discord settings.
* Run the `/bparty` command.
    * This command will set the _party password_ 
    to a randomly generated string so that other users can easily join the party.  
    Don't worry, the password will only be shared internally with the users who accept the invite.
    * If you would like to set a custom password, use `/bparty YOUR_PASSWORD`.
* Check your Discord client, you should see a green "play" button in your chat box.
