## Installing unreleased versions <small>(for advanced users)</small>
#### LabyMod
1. Download **BeezigLaby** from [this page](https://github.com/Beezig/BeezigLaby/releases/latest).
    * If you already have a BeezigLaby file for a newer build, skip this step.
2. Open your `.minecraft` folder.
    * On Windows, it is located at `%appdata%/.minecraft`.
    * On Mac OS, its location is `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft`.
    * On Linux, you can find it at `~/.minecraft`.
3. Locate the `LabyMod` folder, and open it.
4. Open the `addons-1.8` folder.
5. Remove any **jar** files related to `Beezig` (ex. `Beezig - The Hive Support.jar`).
    * Make sure not to remove the **folder** called `Beezig`!
6. Drag and drop the `BeezigLaby.jar` file you downloaded into this folder.
7. (Optional - **Recommended**) Rename the file to `Beezig - The Hive Support.jar` so it gets overwritten by
LabyMod when a newer release comes out.
