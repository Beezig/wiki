We added over 40 additional commands, which are explained below. (In alphabetical order) Tab-Completion available with BeezigForge ! Most commands feature tab-completion, which lets you easily enter names or other values. Still, this feature will require the BeezigForge addon! All commands \u00b6 This list is valid for Beezig 6.0 If you are playing on another version, this information may have changed. Run /beezig to get your version. All 'game' or 'mode' terminology used requires the shortcode of the game to be used.
